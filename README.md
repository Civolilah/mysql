# MYSQL faculty workshops

The repository is based on workshops and exams from the faculty. Most of them were written in Bosnia because it was the native language of all professors at the university.

To run SQL scripts, select one of the IDEs (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18, etc.), paste the code from .sql files and see the result.

Even if you don't understand Bosnia, I hope you will understand the knowledge I gained from these workshops.

Thanks,
Abedin
